With the world in an abyss of uncertainty over whether to remain somewhat united or splinter off into factions, the United States finds itself at a crossroads. One that will shake the world to its core. The New Deal Coalition is now torn asunder, and all that's left is an all-out war between President Wallace and Governor Thurmond for the fate of what was once the party of those such as Jackson, Bryan, and Wilson.</p><p> The Republicans, who are not exempt from this factionalism, find themselves trying to mend fences in an attempt to capture the White House after four devastating defeats during a rising tide of conservatism and isolationism not unlike three decades before. After a rough primary, Robert Taft looks to bring traditional Republican values right back into the limelight.</p><button onclick='next0()'>More</button>"
