But things won’t get any easier from here. Now you have to try and make your own case if you want to keep these insane ideas of desegregation out of Congress.

Kefauver is himself a New Deal Southerner, who may just be persuaded to hold off on any Civil Rights legislation in exchange for support for expanding the New Deal and his idea of a Kefauver Committee, meant to route out corruption. Or Dirksen, a major Republican conservative who aligns more with your own economic policies, yet has also expressed support for the NRA in many closed circles, from what you can tell, but to roll back the New Deal, he might just be willing to shelve these social progress.
