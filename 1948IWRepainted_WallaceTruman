In a shocking turn of events you’ve managed to capture every single state in the country!</p><p>Robert Taft suffers a pulmonary embolism at seeing his Party collapse into dust, as the Republicans lose every seat in Congress! Strom Thurmond is burned at the stake for his racist views and blacks revolt throughout the country to bring a new era of Negro Rights! There are no more political parties left after this result beyond the newly formed Progressive Democratic Party, led by you! Any naysayers are instantly booted out. After all, who the hell needs Moderates in the Age of Wallace!</p><p>The same Bullmoose you’d been apart of since 1912 is now back in action as the only force in American Politics!</p><p>With the people firmly behind you, the skies the limit! You could run for 3rd, 4th, 5th, maybe even a 6th term should you so choose. Congratulations Henry, you’ve made sure the name Wallace will go down in history as a Progressive forward thinking one for the rest of time!</p>"];
