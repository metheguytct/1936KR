Al Gore, as sitting Vice President, tries to rally the Clinton Republicans, moderates, and liberals to vote to keep the White House blue, while former Vice President Dan Quayle attempts to chart a new direction for the U.S. The economy has been booming, until quite recently, but President Clinton was only recently dragged through an embarassing scandal.<br><br>Candidates will debate what to do with a $200 billion budget surplus, Quayle's competence, Bill Clinton's infidelity, and Gore's heavily pro-environmental views, among other things. Can Gore maintain the large but fragile lead he starts with? Can Quayle make his case to the American people that he's ready for the step up to POTUS?\",

After a strong showing in Iowa, (triumphing over his former boss's son, among others), Quayle ran away with the nomination.  Quayle’s nomination is a victory for the populist conservatism of people like Rush Limbaugh and Newt Gingrich, having spent his campaign attacking 'liberal Republicans' almost as much as the Democrats. <br><br>With Pat Buchanan declining a run with the Reform Party to endorse him, the Republican party faithful are fired up and united behind Quayle. However, the thing most Americans know Quayle for is his numerous and embarrassing gaffes in office, from his misspelling of 'potato' to his feud with Murphy Brown. But if Quayle can get past all that, the prospect of a Quayle presidency- once the subject of mockery- might not be so far-fetched.",

He can embrace the legacy of Clinton, for better or worse. Politically, he can run as a centrist, or move to the left and run as a more traditional liberal Democrat than Clinton did. The presence of the well-known Ralph Nader as a Green Party candidate complicates this decision, as this means that Gore is essentially campaigning on two fronts.
