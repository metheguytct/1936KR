A supporter of Teddy Roosevelt's Progressive Party and his 1912 election bid, Landon eventually became the leader of the Kansas liberal Republican caucus. In 1932, he was elected as the Kansas state governor in an exceptionally tight race, and narrowly won re-election 2 years later, building a reputation as a soft-spoken reformist Republican in a time where they are becoming an increasingly rare sight.<br>Landon was backed by the Republican party machinery as a centrist in a polarized political field dominated by loud personalities and radicalism.

Olson was never supposed to become President of the United States. Born in the north side of Minneapolis in 1891 to a Norwegian father and a Swedish mother, Olson grew up serving as a shabbos goy for the local Jewish community, then briefly working for the Northern Pacific Railway before dropping out of university and heading west to work odd jobs in Canada and Alaska, and then Seattle where he joined the International Workers of the World for a time, picking up a quasi-socialist ideology he would hold throughout his life. In 1913 he returned to Minnesota to study law, and became the Hennepin Country attorney by 1920. He became known as a tough prosecutor, taking on corrupt businessmen, the Ku Klux Klan, and the conservative Minnesota Citizens Alliance after the latter hired a hitman to blow up the home of a union leader. During this time, Olson aligned as a Progressive, a Democrat, and eventually as a Farmer-Labor nominee - and was rewarded when he became that party's first governor of Minnesota.<br>The fact that the Republican and Democratic establishment felt it necessary to put such a radical candidate at the head of their unity ticket is a stark sign of desperation - the Socialist Party of America was regretfully determined to be the biggest danger, and Olson's candidacy was aimed to convince SPA voters to once again bet on reform. This was not a decision easily made, however - as Olson stands as the only man that might talk down the syndicalists, some conservative Democrats wonder if they made the wrong choice, and it's possible that they may throw their hat in with America First if Olson is seen as selling out to socialism.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#d36464","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/portrait_usa_floyd_olson.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>You win!</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>You lose</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>huh.</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1014,"fields":{"first_name":"Quentin","last_name":"Roosevelt","election":8,"party":"National Unity[Democrat (Progressive)]","state":"New York","priority":1,"description":"Quentin Roosevelt is the son of Former President Theodore Roosevelt.Quentin served bravely in the Weltkrieg,before going on to serve as a Senator.
