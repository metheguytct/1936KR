Born to a business family on the West Coast, he lived an unassuming upper-class life until studies in Harvard, where he, coming into contact with socialist clubs and literature, came to realize that there is a world beyond the dull halls of college, and that world suffered constant hardship. Despite being in poor health from birth, Reed chose a traveller's life, working as a common laborer to make a living and travel from nation to nation, and gaining fame as a war correspondent.<br>What earned him more fame, however, was his involvement in the great revolutions of the period. The first he witnessed was the Mexican one as early as 1913, then the Russian one, in 1917, which he worked for devoutly and which consolidated his revolutionary socialist beliefs. It was during this time period that he wrote the 10 Days That Shook the World, his most famous work. In 1918, he returned to America, but was no longer welcome by America and its anti-sedition acts, so a year later, he fled again - this time to France, to a new, brewing revolution, and unlike the Russian one, actually successful. Fighting alongside the French Syndicalists dictated Reed a goal in life - to import this success to America, to have it be the next to come, and with America's unfathomable industrial might, bring forth a world revolution.<br><br>A long time has passed since then, and Reed has achieved far - he has helped orchestrate the union of American socialists into one united front, served as a Senator, And finally as a Presidential candidate. However, his goal remains the same - to be the next great revolutionary, to be the same figure greater than life which the lowly war correspondent from twenty years ago would write about.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#ff0000","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/portrait_csa_jack_reed.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1009,"fields":{"first_name":"Norman","last_name":"Thomas","election":8,"party":"Socialist","state":"New York","priority":1,"description":"Norman Thomas is the Mayor of New York City.

Within a shockingly brief time, he was already one of the most famous politicians in Louisiana, and so became one of the youngest governors in its history as a result.<br>Louisiana would become the model province for a set of programs and policies which would collectively be labelled 'Share Our Wealth'. Long built a vast public services apparatus and an unprecedented system of social spending upon a patronage system which swiftly transformed Louisiana into a dictatorship, with the Long family at the helm. In America's increasingly volatile conditions, however, such forceful measures to help the poor became increasingly popular and thus formed the policy backbone of the America First Party, to whom Louisiana was an ideal to reach towards. Thanks to Long's increasingly wide and fragile reach of contacts and alliances across the whole country, it grew far out of Louisiana, and today,Long hopes to try these ideas on the rest of the country.","color_hex":"#acacec","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/portrait_tex_huey_long.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1011,"fields":{"first_name":"William","last_name":"Lemke","election":8,"party":"America First","state":"North Dakota","priority":1,"description":"William Lemke is a representative from North Dakota.

Olson was never supposed to become President of the United States. Born in the north side of Minneapolis in 1891 to a Norwegian father and a Swedish mother, Olson grew up serving as a shabbos goy for the local Jewish community, then briefly working for the Northern Pacific Railway before dropping out of university and heading west to work odd jobs in Canada and Alaska, and then Seattle where he joined the International Workers of the World for a time, picking up a quasi-socialist ideology he would hold throughout his life. In 1913 he returned to Minnesota to study law, and became the Hennepin Country attorney by 1920. He became known as a tough prosecutor, taking on corrupt businessmen, the Ku Klux Klan, and the conservative Minnesota Citizens Alliance after the latter hired a hitman to blow up the home of a union leader. During this time, Olson aligned as a Progressive, a Democrat, and eventually as a Farmer-Labor nominee - and was rewarded when he became that party's first governor of Minnesota.<br>The fact that the Republican and Democratic establishment felt it necessary to put such a radical candidate at the head of their unity ticket is a stark sign of desperation - the Socialist Party of America was regretfully determined to be the biggest danger, and Olson's candidacy was aimed to convince SPA voters to once again bet on reform. This was not a decision easily made, however - as Olson stands as the only man that might talk down the syndicalists, some conservative Democrats wonder if they made the wrong choice, and it's possible that they may throw their hat in with America First if Olson is seen as selling out to socialism.","color_hex":"#0000ff","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/portrait_usa_floyd_olson.png","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1015,"fields":{"first_name":"Quentin ","last_name":"Roosevelt","election":8,"party":"National Unity(Democrat)","state":"New York","priority":1,"description":" The youngest son of former president Theodore Roosevelt, from an early age Quentin was groomed for political activism in his father's Republican Party.
